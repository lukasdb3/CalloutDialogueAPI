# DAGDialogueSystem-API

## What is this?
DAGDialogueSytem is developed in C#. Its primary purpose is to generate distinctive dialogue scenarios using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This plugin is exclusively compatible with the LSPDFR plugin and RagePluginHook plugin. To function properly, it mandates the presence of RageNativeUI. Developers who use this API can expect extensive customization options, as the plugin offers full customization capabilities, allowing for the creation of highly personalized dialogue scenarios within the supported platforms.

## Why?
I got tired of coding dialogue in ForestryCallouts2 for one callout for hours, then looking back at it a week later trying to fix typos with not screwing anything else up.

## Current Status?
Not usable yet. Still a WIP but I am getting close to getting it done!
